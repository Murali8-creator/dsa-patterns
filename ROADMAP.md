# DSA Patterns Roadmap

> "You don't learn algorithms by memorizing solutions. You learn them by recognizing which tool fits the shape of the problem."

## Philosophy

**Don't memorize solutions. Recognize patterns.**

For each pattern we will:
1. **Solve it brute-force first** — write the O(n²) or O(2ⁿ) solution that works
2. **Feel the pain** — see the TLE, the redundant work, the wasted space
3. **Discover the pattern** — introduce it as an optimization to a problem you now understand
4. **Implement it in Java** — clean, hands-on code you write yourself
5. **Analyze complexity** — time & space, best/worst/average cases

---

## The Decision Tree

Before picking a pattern, ask: **"What is the shape of this problem?"**

| #  | Sub-Pattern                    | Core Idea                                           | Status |
|----|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 89 | XOR — Single / Missing Number  | XOR cancels pairs, leaving the odd one out          | [ ]    |
| 90 | Power of Two / Four            | Bit tricks: n & (n-1) == 0                          | [ ]    |
| 91 | Counting Bits (DP)             | Count 1-bits for 0..n using DP relation             | [ ]    |
| 92 | Hamming Weight                 | Count set bits in an integer                        | [ ]    |

**Practice problems:** Find the Difference, Counting Bits, Single Number

### Phase 15: Design Patterns (Data Structure Design)

| #  | Sub-Pattern                    | Core Idea                                           | Status |
|----|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 93 | Trie (Prefix Tree)             | Tree of characters for prefix search / autocomplete | [ ]    |
| 94 | LRU / LFU Cache                | HashMap + Doubly Linked List for O(1) cache ops     | [ ]    |
| 95 | HashMap Design                 | Implement hash map from scratch                     | [ ]    |
| 96 | Stack / Queue from Primitives  | Implement stack using queues and vice versa          | [ ]    |
| 97 | Circular Queue / Deque         | Ring buffer for fixed-size queue                     | [ ]    |
| 98 | Iterator Design                | Flatten nested structures, custom iteration          | [ ]    |
| 99 | Special Data Structures        | All O(1), Insert/Delete/GetRandom, Hit Counter       | [ ]    |

**Practice problems:** Implement Trie, Design Add and Search Words, LFU Cache, Design HashMap, Design Stack with Increment, All O(1) Data Structure, Detect Squares, Design Text Editor, Design Search Autocomplete, Flatten Nested List Iterator, Insert Delete GetRandom O(1), Design Circular Queue/Deque, Encode and Decode Strings, Design Hit Counter, Logger Rate Limiter

## How Each Session Works

```
1. THE PROBLEM     → I describe a scenario / LeetCode-style problem
2. BRUTE FORCE     → You write the naive solution that works
3. THE PAIN        → We analyze: what's the time/space complexity? Why does it TLE?
4. THE PATTERN     → I introduce the pattern as the optimization
5. YOU IMPLEMENT   → You refactor using the pattern
6. THE ANALYSIS    → Time/space complexity, edge cases, when does this pattern apply?
```
